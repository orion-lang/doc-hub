SUBDOMAIN_DISCOVERY_PROMPT = """You are analyzing a specific domain within a developer portal to identify its SUBDOMAINS.

DOMAIN: {domain_name}
DOMAIN DESCRIPTION: {domain_description}

CONTENT BELONGING TO THIS DOMAIN:
{domain_content}

A SUBDOMAIN is a specific topic, feature, or concept within the parent domain.
Example: For "Authentication" domain:
- oauth (OAuth 2.0 flows)
- api_keys (API key management)  
- tokens (Access/refresh tokens)
- scopes (Permission scopes)
- sessions (Session management)

RULES:
1. Subdomains should be specific but not too granular
2. Each subdomain should have at least 2-3 pieces of content
3. Subdomains should cover distinct topics (minimal overlap)
4. Use snake_case for names

For each subdomain provide:
- name: snake_case identifier
- display_name: Human readable name
- description: What this subdomain covers
- keywords: 5-10 words/phrases specific to this subdomain
- differentiator: How to distinguish from other subdomains

Return JSON:
{{
    "domain": "{domain_name}",
    "subdomains": [
        {{
            "name": "oauth",
            "display_name": "OAuth 2.0",
            "description": "OAuth 2.0 authorization flows and implementation",
            "keywords": ["oauth", "authorization code", "client credentials", "pkce", "redirect", "authorization"],
            "differentiator": "Specifically about OAuth protocol, not general auth"
        }}
