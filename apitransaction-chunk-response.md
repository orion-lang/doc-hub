Based on the Wells Fargo Transaction Detail API v3 documentation, here are synthetic search queries with the actual document chunks that would be returned as search results:

## Synthetic Search Queries and Document Chunks

### Query 1: "Wells Fargo transaction search API pagination"
**Returned Chunk:**
```
The Transaction Detail API returns a default maximum of 50 transactions per page. To change the maximum number of transactions returned per page, change the value in the limit field in your request. Note: The value for limit cannot exceed 100 transactions per page. Using pagination, a customer may potentially have resulting data sets with up to 999,999 transactions. We recommend implementing controls or safeguards to ensure that large amounts of data are not accidentally retrieved. If the total number of transactions exceeds the limit, the Transaction Detail API uses cursors to navigate through the records. Cursors provide a means to navigate to the next page (next_cursor) and to the previous page (previous_cursor) of transactions.
```

### Query 2: "ACH transaction field name Wells Fargo"
**Returned Chunk:**
```
Valid values for ACH transactions:
• COID - ACH company ID: Identifying number of the company originating the ACH transaction.
